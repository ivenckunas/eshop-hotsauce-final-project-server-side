# MERN project: Hot Sauce E-Shop

The server is built using Node.js and Express, and connects to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve data for the project. The server handles requests from the client-side, such as user authentication and CRUD operations, and uses middleware to handle validations and authentication. Socket.io is used for real-time communication, such as updating reviews in real-time.
